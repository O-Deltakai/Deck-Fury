  HintList:
  - 'During the <b>Combat Phase</b>, you will be unable to enter the <b>Planning
    Phase</b> until your <b>Energy</b> is full.


    Your <b>Energy</b> will slowly
    recharge during combat, and <b>defeating enemies using cards</b> will grant you
    a small amount of additional <b>Energy</b>.


    For the purposes of this tutorial,
    I have set your <b>Energy</b> to charge much quicker than normal so you don''t
    have to wait as long to access your cards.'
  - 'The <b><color=#6DEDFF>blue number</color></b> next to your character is your
    <b><color=#6DEDFF>Shields</color></b>. Any damage you take is taken to your <b><color=#6DEDFF>Shields</color></b>
    before your <b>Health</b> (the big white number just above your Shields number).


    You
    will recover your <b><color=#6DEDFF>Shields</color></b> between stages, but your
    <b>Health will not</b>, so be careful about taking damage once your <color=#6DEDFF>Shields</color>
    are down because damage taken to your <b>Health</b> is much more difficult to
    recover than <b>Shields</b>.
