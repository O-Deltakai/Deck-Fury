  HintList:
  - 'The <b><color=yellow>Aimpoint</color></b> indicates where you are aiming currently.
    You can move your mouse around your character to adjust your <b><color=yellow>Aimpoint</color></b>.


    The
    <b><color=yellow>Aimpoint</color></b> may change size and position depending
    on what <b>card</b> you are using.


    You are only able to aim in the <b>4
    cardinal directions</b>.'
  - 'You always have access to a basic attack that fires a projectile, which you
    can activate with <b>Left Click</b>.


    Try using your basic attack to destroy
    the training robot above you.'
  - 'As you can see, <b>your basic attack is pretty weak</b>, and I would not use
    it personally unless an enemy is already near-death, or you have no better options.


'
  - 'If only there was something else we could use that dealt more damage...


    <i>When
    you''re ready, move to the right into the next area.</i>'
