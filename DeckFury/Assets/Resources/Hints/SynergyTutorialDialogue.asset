  HintList:
  - "On regular combat stages, you always start the stage in the <b>Planning Phase</b>.
    \n\nThis way, you can first survey the battlefield and consider your options
    before beginning combat. Once you leave the <b>Planning Phase</b> you will enter
    the <b>Combat Phase</b>."
  - 'In (Insert Title Name), cards are designed with <b>synergy and combos</b> in
    mind, meaning it is important to consider not just the effect of a card individually,
    but how it may interact with other cards as well.


    For example, check out
    the new <b>Force Blast</b> card that I''ve added to your card selection.'
  - 'The <b>Force Blast</b> card synergizes well with the <b>Fire Bomb</b> card.
    I''ll leave it up to you to figure out why that is the case.


    Consider the
    effect cards have on the <b>environment</b> as well. Once you''ve entered the
    Combat Phase, try using <b>Force Blast</b> on the </b>Red Explosive Barrels</b>.'
  - When you're ready, <b>Left-Click</b> on the big green tick box to load your card
    magazine and enter the <b>Combat Phase</b>.
