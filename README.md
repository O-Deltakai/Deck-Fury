Deck Fury is my first serious foray into game development, and the current state of this game took me around 6 months to get to. This is my first and only released game thus far and is a passion project through and through.

This game was inspired by the Megaman Battle Network (MMBN) series, a GBA game made back in the old days and Deck Fury borrows quite a few concepts and ideas from it. I've always loved the MMBN series and was disappointed to see there were very few spiritual successors to the game. That's where I got the idea to make one myself, and here we are.

As the game is in alpha there are still a number of features missing and the amount of content is fairly low for now as I try to build out the infrastructure needed for future mechanics and content. That being said, Deck Fury is technically a complete experience with a start and end as well as some degree of replayability due to its rogue-like nature.
